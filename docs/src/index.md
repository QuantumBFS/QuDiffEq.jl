# QuDiffEq

*A General Purpose Quantum Computation Simulation Framework*

[QuDiffEq](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/QuDiffEq.jl) is a package for solving differential equations using quantum algorithms. It makes use of the Yao.jl, a quantum simulator in Julia.


## Features
- Quantum algorithms for linear differential equation
    - Based on  HHL.
    - Based on Truncated Taylor series
- Quantum algorithm for non-linear differential equation
